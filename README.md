## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

> **Note** generate a new Helius **API key** via [Helius Dashboard](https://dev.helius.xyz/dashboard/app)

To test webhooks we recommend creating a reverse proxy to your local machine on which your localhost websever is running. We suggest using **ngrok**, which you can set up by following these [instructions](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started)

> **Note** ask DevOps engineer to generate new IAM user credentials for you


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

> **Warning** make sure your node version matches the one specified in `.nvmrc`

Install dependencies and copy the `.env.example` content into `.env`:

```bash
npm install & cp .env.example .env
```

Next run the command for generating env variables and replace placeholder values from `.env` as per instructions in the terminal. Fill in any remaining variables by following notes from the [.env section](#üå±-env):

```bash
npm run generate-env
```

Then run migrations and seed the database:

```bash
npm run migrate:dev
```

```bash
npm run seed
```

Once steps above completed, run the following command to start the project in watch mode:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3005](http://localhost:3005) with your browser to see the result. API documentation is available on the [/api](http://localhost:3005/api) route


## üå± .env
- **`JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`** and **`JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`** are randomly generated 42 char strings
- **`SOLANA_CLUSTER`** can be either `mainnet-beta`, `testnet` or `devnet`. Rule of thumb is to use `devnet` on localhost development, and `mainnet-beta` for production applications
- **`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`** and **`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`** are necessary for app to work as intended since app relies on AWS S3 for file storage. These credentials can be obtained upon IAM user creation (contact DevOps to create IAM user for you)
- **`SOLANA_RPC_NODE_ENDPOINT`** is necessary for application to be able to execute any blockchain-specific actions. Not all nodes are reliable 100% of time so it's best to be aware of alternatives! If your default Solana node is underperforming, feel free to find a new one [here](https://www.allthatnode.com/solana.dsrv) or [here](https://github.com/open-sauce-labs/solomon/blob/master/src/constants/rpcNodeProviders.ts). To understand limitations of the default node check out official [Solana RPC endpoint documentation](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints)
- **`TREASURY_PRIVATE_KEY`** is the AES encrypted private key of a wallet used as a Treasury. All royalties will be collected there and all our payments will be done with it.
- **`TREASURY_SECRET`** is the secret key used for AES encription/decription of the Treasury wallet's private key, preferably 64 byte long
- **`MAIL_SERVICE`** and other mail related variables are unnecessary unless working on features which rely on email sending. Make sure to [download NodemailerApp](https://nodemailer.com/app) in that case
- **`HELIUS_API_KEY`** can be obtained via [Helius Dashboard](https://dev.helius.xyz/dashboard/app)
